										<h2>Texty</h2>

									<h2>Short Description</h2>
									<p>
										Nowadays many people prefer text messages over calls. Texty enables people to send text messages to businesses that are still missing the ability to communicate in this way. 
										<br/>
										This app is still in development and will soon be available on the AppStore.
									</p>
									<h2>My Role</h2>
									<p>
										Sole developer. This app has a beautiful and modern design which was also a challenge to implement.

										<h2>Cardio</h2>

									<h2>Short Description</h2>
									<p>
										Cardio is a health application designed to aid users in tracking their blood pressure and heart rate using a bluetooth connected device. Patients receive daily tasks they need to complete; They might have to complete health questionnaires or measure their blood pressure and heart rate.
										<br/>
										The app is still in development.
									</p>
									<h2>My Role</h2>
									<p>
										A big part of this app was already done. My initial task was to integrate the Objective C library used to connect the bluetooth connected health device. Afterwards I also integrated a database to store user's data. Displaying the data on a period of time was also a challenge I tackled by building a custom charts class. Because this was a medical app I had to get accustomed to the FHIR specifications.

										<h2>MasjidLink</h2>

									<h2>Short Description</h2>
									<p>
										MasjidLink is an app designed for Muslims to connect with the Mosques or Businesses. Users can see all the events and announcements of an Organization (either Mosque or Business) after linking to it and they'll also get Adhan and Iqamah time changes notifications. Admins can also do quick edits of their Organizations from within the app.
										<br/>
										The app is currently on the AppStore and being used on a daily basis.
									</p>
									<h2>My Role</h2>
									<p>
										Developer in a team of two. I created the basic structure, defined the architecture and laid out the foundation of the app. I've also integrated CI using Fastlane. Afterwards, my role shifted towards supervising and I only stepped in when needed.

											<h2>Keyvent</h2>
										</header>
										<h2>Short Description</h2>
										<p>Keyvent is an online ticketing platform. The app enables users to see featured events near them, search for events using different filters, buy tickets and see them in app. When a ticket is bought, a QR-code is generated and users have to get it scanned at entrance. 
											<br/>
											After a few months on the AppStore, I had to take it down since it lost backend support.</p>
										<h2>My Role</h2>
										<p>Sole developer. There was nothing created, only some vague mock-ups. Going through all the steps from defining the features, to creating the designs and finally the application was a great journey. We wanted to release the app in China as well, that's why I had to create multiple targets and some classes were totally different for the Chinese version of the app. One big difference was that we couldn't use Stripe to handle payments in China. We also couldn't use Google and Facebook logins.

											<h2>Keyvent Manager</h2>
										</header>
										<h2>Short Description</h2>
										<p>
											This app allows event employees to scan event tickets (QR-codes) at the entrance. Employees can grant or deny access. There's also a fallback to enter the code manually if the scan doesn't work.
											<br/>
											This application is currently on the AppStore and it's being used to scan tickets.
										</p>
										<h2>My Role</h2>
										<p>
											Sole developer. Same as Keyvent app, I ran through the whole process from design to development with this app. Because this app uses camera to scan QR-codes, battery can easily drain so the scanning stops after a few minutes of inactivity. We also wanted to improve the scanning experience so I've added some beautiful animations using Lottie.</p>

											<h2>Noise Festival</h2>
										</header>
										<h2>Short Description</h2>
										<p>
											This was a companion app for a festival that took place in Brasov, Romania called Noise Festival. Users were able to see the artists, listen to their songs, see the news, the partners, info about the city and how to get there and most importantly, the stage times. They would also get real-time updates about who's going to perform next and on which stage.
											<br/>
											The app is currently not on the AppStore because it no longer brings any value after the Festival has ended.
										</p>
										<h2>My Role</h2>
										<p>
											Developer in a team of two. The app was 80% complete when I stepped in and I had to redesign the home page with the draggable view on bottom, create the Stages and Partners tabs.
